in this i am going into write the important things about the github
  // before running any of these command u need to be in the cd to the file create for eg " ~/OneDrive/Desktop/test/test-_repository" because in this test-_repository there will be the git file 

  // to change the parent directory for which u want to psuh to
   [ git remote -v  ] // this will the tell the origin of the file u are working upon  
   [ git remote remove origin  ]    // this will remove the origin from your directory to someone else directory
   [ git remote add origin https://github.com/janvitekwani/test-_repository.git  ]   // to add the new origin directory 

  // to clone the project 
   [ git clone https://github.com/janvitekwani/test-_repository.git  ]    // git command to clone the project 

   // if u want to pull to your own repo 
   [ git pull origin main ]   // to do make the pull request every time the changes are made in the code 

   // this is when u want to push to your own repo 
   [ git add . ]   // git add . is used to add all the files 
   [ git commit -m "first new" ]   // this is used to commit the message
   [ git push origin main  ]     // to do make the push request 


    // but if u directly want to push to someone else repo , u need to be the contributer of the change the orgin to there repo and then push but for this u need to be contribute which leads to lots of permission u will get lot's of permission
